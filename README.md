# UX (User Experience)
## Website Owner Goals

The main purpose for the website is to serve as a central hub of information on the Samurai / Shogun Era of Japan. Through informative text and images/videos this will entice the user further on the history of Japan. With several images showcasing the armaments and also a contact us page so if users have additional questions or any queries they can contact the website host.

The main purpose for this is to engage the user in a fun quiz based on the Marvel franchise. Through a range of questions from each of the franchises movies this will eventually culminate to a score at the end, where the user can save there score against other players or to improve themselves.  

## User Goals
### First-time Users
+ The user can easily identify the main purpose of the site through titles and named buttons
+ The user can easily navigate to the high score page and see a list of there own score including other players too
+ The user can select the rules button to open a pop up that will advise the user on what to do and also a brief history of Marvel Studios.

## Wireframes
The following image shows a wireframe of each of the 4 pages of the site. These wireframes were created using [MockPlus](https://user.mockplus.com/signin?next=https://app.mockplus.com/app).

# Features

### Common Elements
The common elements across all pages will be the background theme (Avengers - Iron man vs Captain America) and also the colour theme (Red,Blue and Green)

+ The Wallpaper - I decided to use the below wallpaper across all screens in this quiz site. Due to Marvel movie Civil War being one of the highest grossing movies and also a personal favourite. I find the image very strike with the traditional Marvel colours making it stand out.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectTwo-Quiz/blob/main/assets/readmeimages/marvelwallpaper.jpg">


### Home Page
This is the main landing page which the user will be first presented with, with big bold texts showcasing what the main function of the site is. By using a eye catching wallpaper and the Avengers themed colours i hope to keep users interested in viewing the site. This page contains the following elements below:

+ Home Screen - The image of 2 of the leading characters in the movie franchise in head to head combat is a very striking image for the user, i've also used the 3 colours signified for the Marvel franchise Blue,Red and Green which relates to the big 3 characters in the movies Captain America, Iron man and the Incredible Hulk.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectTwo-Quiz/blob/main/assets/readmeimages/homescreen.png">

+ Audio Player - I've added a audio player beneath the 'Rules' button. When play is selected the Marvel intro theme will commence playing and the user can decide to pause or continue. I wanted to ensure that the music does not automatically play when the user first loads the site as i rather the user has control on this function (in case user is in a library or just doesn't want to listen to music!) 

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectTwo-Quiz/blob/main/assets/readmeimages/miniplayer.png">

### Play

This is the second page of the website and showcases 17 images and 2 videos (linked to youtube). The images are arranged out in a grid area and each image when hovered over shows a text commenting on what the image relates to. I've also ensured when selecting the image this will open a new page allowing the user to view the image clearly. 

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/gallery1.jpg">

Further down the Gallery page, i've added text using the same Japanese calligraphy style/color i've used on the other page for consistency. The text advises the user to view the videos linked directly to youtuve for further information on the 'Life of a Samurai' and a quick 'Shogunate Japan in 2 minutes".

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/gallery2.jpg">  

### Contact us page
The Contact us page contains a table which can be filled on the four sections. I ensured the background of the table matches the header/footer color for aesthetics and also the text to be easily visible. This page primary function is for users to submit any additional questions they may have on the historic events during the Shogun dynasty.

### Submitted page
The submission page generates once the user has submitted there details across via the contact us form. This page also has a link within the text to take the user back to the home page.

# Testing

## Cross-Browser Testing
I have tested this website across the 3 main web browsers Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge & Safari (using my MAC). The site loaded consistently across all 3 with no issues detected.

## Compatibility Testing
I tested the site across differing devices, using my old model iPhone 8, Dell Laptop and my iMac. I've used several different browsers and no issues were detected between any of these devices.

## Responsiveness Testing
-----------------------------
Throughout the process of creating the site, i've used Google Chromes Developer tools to test the responsiveness of the site. I've used 3 seperate dimensions to test and design the site for different screen sizes. 
 
+ 1280px width and below 
+ 800px width and below 
+ 400px width and below 
-------------------------------

## User Testing
I've ensured the navigation was very clearly accessible for all screen sizes (Mobiles and desktops) and that all information were clear to read with backgrounds that do not collide in colors. I also wanted to make the website aesthetically appealing with the scrolling images. 

I've also ensured the Contact Us form correctly sends the user to the thankyou page once the data is submitted, and the form data validation works correctly. I attempted to submit without filling out each field, and was presented with a message to fill out the required data (First name, Last name, Email). When attempting to use a non-valid email address in the email field, the relevant error message appeared asking to use the correct format. I've also added a reset button in case the user wishes to clear all the data on the form and start again. 

## Validator Testing

The HTML of the website was tested using the validator at [https://validator.w3.org/]. 

I've been advised of the below errors and have now corrected all of them and the site passed the validator.

+ Missing closing tag for images within Gallery.
+ Footer link error for social links.
+ Missing <"/div"> within contact us page.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/htmlcheck.jpg">

The CSS was tested using the validator at [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] and no errors were reported.

## Performance Testing

I used the extension "Lighthouse" within Google Chrome Developer Tools and the results ranged from 90% - 93% which i am content with.

## Errors, Bugs or Issues During Development

While testing several devices i encountered an issue with the contact us form. On smaller screened iphones i found the contact us page spread across the screen where the user is unable to read what the entry field correlates to. After several alterations and testing within CSS and adjusting the size i eventually got the table to a size i am happy with as shown below.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/ProjectOne/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/smallphone.jpg">

## Improvements for the Site

During the finalizing process of developing the site, i soon thought of several different methods of how i could have improved this site and implement these ideas in the future for other projects:

+ Improve the aesthetic for smaller devices when viewing the footer, initially i liked the "stacked" style of it but thought perhaps it might appear too clunky and should match how the site looks on larger screens.

+ Use higher resolution images especially for the header logo, as this counted towards my grading for the "lighthouse" check i've used in Google developer tools.
